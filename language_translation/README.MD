# Language translation project on Udacity deep learning nanodegree

## Introduction

In this project, you’re going to take a peek into the realm of neural network machine translation.  You’ll be training a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French.

## Environment & Tools
